              <p>
                Rouge, now known as Guy Crimson, is the first and most powerful
                among the Primordial Daemons. He proudly declares himself the
                first Demon Lord and possesses an overbearing personality. Guy
                is highly confident and doesn't hesitate to use coercion and
                threats to enforce his beliefs. He is recognizable by his
                flowing crimson red hair and eyes. Guy Crimson is loyal only to
                himself and currently resides in the Ice Continent as its ruler.

              <p>
                Noir, now known as Diablo, is the Black Primordial. He is often
                considered an oddball among daemons due to his different values,
                particularly regarding the pursuit of power. After being
                summoned by Rimuru Tempest, Noir immediately pledged his undying
                loyalty and remains fiercely devoted to him. He is distinguished
                by his signature full butler attire with white gloves, as well
                as black hair with a strand of red in the front. Diablo is loyal
                to Rimuru Tempest and currently resides in the Jura Tempest
                Federation.

                Blanc, now known as Testarossa, is the White Primordial. Despite
                her gentle appearance, she possesses one of the most terrifying
                personalities among the Daemons. In the Lake Shore Dyed Scarlet
                Incident, she massacred an entire city to avenge a friend. After
                swearing loyalty to Rimuru Tempest, Testarossa gets involved in
                political manipulations, coercing other members of the Western
                states council to further her goals. She is distinguished by her
                silver hair, snow-white skin, and red eyes. Testarossa is loyal
                to Rimuru Tempest and currently resides in the Jura Tempest
                Federation.

                Jaune, now known as Carrera, is the Yellow Primordial. Prior to
                coming under Rimuru's guidance, she had a hobby of sporadically
                unleashing bursts of Nuclear Magic, often directed towards
                Leon's capital in El Dorado. Although she has seemingly calmed
                down since then, those who knew her before still view her as a
                menace. Carrera is distinguished by her short blonde hair and
                blue eyes. Carrera is loyal to Rimuru Tempest and currently
                resides in the Jura Tempest Federation.

                Violet, now known as Ultima, is the Purple Primordial. Despite
                her youthful appearance, she takes pleasure in being treated
                like a princess by her subordinate Daemons. However, she also
                exhibits a fondness for inflicting pain on others. After being
                convinced by Noir, Ultima becomes loyal to Rimuru. She can be
                recognized by her purple hair with a side ponytail and her
                yellow eyes. Ultima is loyal to Rimuru Tempest and currently
                resides in the Jura Tempest Federation.

                Vert, now known as Misery, is the Green Primordial. As a maid
                alongside Rain under Rouge's command, she takes her
                responsibilities very seriously and dedicates herself entirely
                to her master. Misery goes to the extent of establishing a cult
                centered around aiding Rouge's observations of humans. She is
                characterized by her long, curly green hair and eyes, and she
                wears a deep-red maid outfit. Misery is loyal to Guy Crimson and
                currently resides in the Ice Continent.

                Bleu, now known as Rain, is the Blue Primordial. Despite her
                composed and beautiful appearance, she dislikes working and
                often leaves tasks to Vert. Even in the midst of heated battles,
                Rain tends to complain about various things. She maintains
                unwavering loyalty to Rouge. Rain is identified by her short
